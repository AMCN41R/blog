As a .NET developer, I've used [Visual Studio]() my whole career. It has its moments, but it is undenyably a great tool.

As my career has progressed, so has technology, and with it, the frameworks and tooling.

I've also become a js/ts engineer, and with that, spent alot of time in vs code.

vs code is excellent, plugins, speed, flexibility etc. C# support is good, but can it beat vs?

So I thought, can I do without vs - so decided to do a little test, i would build an application using ONLY vscode.

THE PROJECT...

traditionally, vs, SSMS and postman

this time, just vscode
