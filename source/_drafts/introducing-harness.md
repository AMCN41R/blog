# Harness

Harness is a .NET library designed to manage the state of a Mongo database during testing.

Harness is designed to aid unit and integration testing by putting a Mongo database in a known state at the beginning of test, or suite of tests. The framework allows you to control your codeâ€™s dependency on a Mongo database, therefore increasing test consistency and repeat-ability.

Harness is an open source project, licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/AMCN41R/Harness/blob/dev/LICENSE)

Harness was inspired by [NDBUnit](https://github.com/NDbUnit/NDbUnit).
